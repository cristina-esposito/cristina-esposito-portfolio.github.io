### Data Science Assignments and Projects

#### McKesson Canada Capstone Project
(September 2021 - April 2022)
8 month consulting capstone project for the Master of Management Analytics Program in partnership with McKesson Canada

**Role**: Data Scientist team lead with focus on UX/UI, managed a team of 6 individuals (2 data engineers, 2 modelers, 1 strategist, 1 UX/UI designer) to solve 2 analytics use cases through proof of concepts

_Use Case 1: Scheduled Reporting Automation_
Objective: Design a solution to migrate the McKesson Business Data Strategy and Analytics team's in-house scheduled reporting solution to standardized cloud-based technologies available at McKesson

The solution needed to:
- be cloud based
- be faster to generate reports without delays
- reduce reporting errors

Tools used for the solution:
- Databricks
- Snowflake
- WinSCP
- Apache Spark
- Microsoft Azure
- Outlook
- Power BI

Estimated value/benefit gained from proposed solution:
- Saving +500 hours/year
- Cost savings from manual effors and reduction in errors


_Use Case 2: Exploring Neural Network Models for Sales Forecasting_
Objective: Explore more advanced forecasting models that could potentially outperform existing models and provide more accurate forecasts

Tools used for the exploration:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Python

Dataset:
- +2000 products
- 24 months of sales
- +100k rows

Neural Network Models Tested:
- MLP - multi-layer perceptron
- CNN - convolutional neural network
- Simple RNN - recurrent neural network
- LSTM - long short-term memory
- GRU - gated recurrent units

Why Neural Networks?
- Can learn complex/non-linear patterns
- May not require scaled or stationary time series inputs (i.e. they can learn trend and seasonality components directly)
- Support Multivariate forecasting (i.e. multiple input variables)

Modelling Process:
1. Data Preprocessing --> check missing values, convert negative sales to $0, min-max normalization
2. Data Preparation --> Converting time series structure to supervised learning using sliding window method, split the data to train (34 months) and test (12 months)
3. Model training and selection --> hyper-parameter tuning, select the best model based on test-set RMSE
4. 5-month back-testing the chosen model --> assume the sales of the last 5 months don't exist
5. Forecast products using their respective champion models to project the next 24 months
6. Reporting results --> besides reporting the best model according to lowest RMSE, we also reported the MAPE (easy to comprehend measurement), run-time (want to see how heavy the process is to run the NNs), back tested results, and forecasted results

#### Innovation Youth Capstone Project
2 month consulting capstone project working with a not-for-profit organization on a data analytics solution.

_Objective_: Develop a forecast modelling framework that would allow Innovation Youth to be able to predict how much produce to buy for the bi-weekly solidarity farmer's markets that could be used to make better ordering decisions to reduce left-overs, waste, and better manage costs.

_Data used_:
- Internal data: invoices, attendee tracking sheet, sales data
- Additional/external data: synthetic data for proof of concept demonstration, seasonal produce guide, weather data

_Tools used_ - google suite:
- Google docs for documentation: [documentation how-to manual can be found here](assignments-projects/Innovation-Youth-Capstone/Documentation.docx)
- Google sheets for data collection and dashboarding: [data collection can be found here](assignments-projects/Innovation-Youth-Capstone/MAIN_FARMERS_MARKET.xlsx) [dashboard can be found here](assignments-projects/Innovation-Youth-Capstone/DASHBOARD.xlsx)
- Google collab for forecasting and optimization models using python: [code can be found here](assignments-projects/Innovation-Youth-Capstone/Code.ipynb)
- Google drive for data and file storage

_Models Used_:
- Moving average
- Auto arima
- Seasonal auto arima
- Simple exponential smoothing
- Holt winter's exponential smoothing
- Naive forecasting
- Random forest
- Multiple linear regression
