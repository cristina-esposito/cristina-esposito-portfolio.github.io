### Data Science Assignments and Projects

#### McKesson Canada Capstone Project
8 month consulting capstone project in a team of 5-6 to solve 2 analytics use cases:

_Use Case 1: Automated Reporting_


_Use Case 2: Exploring Neural Network Models for Product Demand Forecasting_



*Note: As this project contains data/information owned by the Company, it cannot be shared publicly 



#### Innovation Youth Capstone Project
2 month consulting capstone project working with a not-for-profit organization on a data analytics solution.

_Objective_: Develop a forecast modelling framework that would allow Innovation Youth to be able to predict how much produce to buy for the bi-weekly solidarity farmer's markets that could be used to make better ordering decisions to reduce left-overs, waste, and better manage costs.

_Data used_:
- Internal data: invoices, attendee tracking sheet, sales data
- Additional/external data: synthetic data for proof of concept demonstration, seasonal produce guide, weather data

_Tools used_ - google suite:
- Google docs for documentation: [documentation how-to manual can be found here](assignments-projects/Innovation-Youth-Capstone/Documentation.docx)
- Google sheets for data collection and dashboarding: [data collection can be found here](assignments-projects/Innovation-Youth-Capstone/MAIN_FARMERS_MARKET.xlsx) [dashboard can be found here](assignments-projects/Innovation-Youth-Capstone/DASHBOARD.xlsx)
- Google collab for forecasting and optimization models using python: [code can be found here](assignments-projects/Innovation-Youth-Capstone/Code.ipynb)
- Google drive for data and file storage

_Models Used_:
- Moving average
- Auto arima
- Seasonal auto arima
- Simple exponential smoothing
- Holt winter's exponential smoothing
- Naive forecasting
- Random forest
- Multiple linear regression
